:wave: and welcome... This repository is under 

Briefly about LLMs...

This lab is split into several, easy to follow exercises that take participants through prototypes of LLM-powered applicaiton hosted in CML. 

Exercises:
1. Jupyter Notebook with LLMs on AWS Bedrock
2. Introduction to Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) with Pinecone Vector DB
3. Ingest relevant data to feed context to an LLM (CML job)
4. Deploy a Q&A application using steps 1-3
5. Swap LLM used in the app to one hosted within CML, along with a hosted vector DB
